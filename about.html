    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>At the Pokémon Center, our mission is to care for Trainers and their Pokémon wherever their journey takes them. From the smallest towns to the largest cities, we provide a safe and welcoming place where Pokémon can rest, recover, and recharge.

Our centers are staffed with knowledgeable and compassionate professionals dedicated to keeping your Pokémon healthy and battle-ready. With state-of-the-art healing technology, convenient PC storage systems, and a fully stocked shop of Trainer essentials, we make sure you’re always prepared for the challenges ahead.

For generations, Pokémon Centers have been more than just healing stations—they are community hubs where Trainers gather, share experiences, and support each other’s adventures. No matter where you are in the world, you can count on the Pokémon Center to stand by you and your team.</p>
